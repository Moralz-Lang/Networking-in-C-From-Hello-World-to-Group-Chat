# Step 2: Simple TCP Server & Client

We built a minimal server and client that exchange one message.

---

## 🔨 What We Built
- A **TCP server** that listens on port 8080 and replies with `"Hello from server"`.
- A **TCP client** that connects to `127.0.0.1:8080` and sends `"Hello from client"`.

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run
Terminal 1 (Server):
```bash
gcc server.c -o server
./server
Terminal 2 (Client):

bash
Copy code
gcc client.c -o client
./client
