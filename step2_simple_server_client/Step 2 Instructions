# Networking in C — Learning Project

This repository is a **complete walkthrough project** for learning **C programming and TCP networking**.  
It is designed like a classroom journey: each step introduces new concepts, includes **checkpoint questions**, and captures **troubleshooting issues** with their solutions.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
By completing this repo, you will learn:
- ✅ How to compile and run C programs with `gcc`
- ✅ Basics of **TCP sockets** (`socket`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`, `connect`)
- ✅ Sending & receiving data over the network with `read` and `send`
- ✅ Handling client disconnections gracefully
- ✅ Using **threads** for concurrency
- ✅ Using **mutexes** for shared data protection
- ✅ Building a **multi-client group chat server**

## 📂 Project Steps
1. [Step 1: Hello World](./step1_hello_world)  
2. [Step 2: Simple TCP Server & Client](./step2_simple_server_client)  
3. [Step 3: Persistent Chat (one client)](./step3_persistent_chat)  
4. [Step 4: Threaded Multi-Client Server](./step4_threaded_server)  
5. [Step 5: Group Chat Server](./step5_group_chat)

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run
Each step folder has its own `README.md` with full instructions.  
General pattern:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output_binary   # compile
./output_binary                   # run
🚀 Final Outcome
By the end, you’ll have built:

A multi-client group chat server in C

A reusable TCP client

Deep understanding of how networking works in C

This repo is designed as a hands-on textbook. Read, compile, run, troubleshoot, and answer the checkpoint questions at each step!
