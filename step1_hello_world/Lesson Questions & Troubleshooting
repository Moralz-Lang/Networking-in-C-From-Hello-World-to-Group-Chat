🚧 Troubleshooting

Issue: “Nothing popped up after gcc hello.c”

Fix: Remember you need to run the compiled file with ./hello.

Issue: “No hello file in folder”

Fix: Run ls to confirm. The compiled binary is created in the same directory.

❓ Checkpoint Questions

Q1: What does gcc hello.c -o hello do?
A1: It compiles hello.c into an executable called hello.

Q2: Why do we need ./hello instead of just hello?
A2: By default, the shell doesn’t search the current directory (.) for executables, so we explicitly run ./hello.
