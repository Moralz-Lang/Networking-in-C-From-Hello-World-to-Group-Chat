🚧 Troubleshooting

Issue: Client disconnects abruptly
✅ Fix: Server detects read() <= 0 and breaks loop.

Issue: Messages overlap or cut off
✅ Fix: Always clear buffer with memset.

❓ Checkpoint Questions

Q1: Why do we need the while(1) loops?
A1: To allow multiple messages instead of stopping after one exchange.

Q2: What happens if the client disconnects unexpectedly?
A2: read() returns 0 or negative, so the server breaks the loop and closes the connection.

Q3: How could you allow multiple clients at once?
A3: By adding threads or select(). That’s what we’ll do in the next step.
