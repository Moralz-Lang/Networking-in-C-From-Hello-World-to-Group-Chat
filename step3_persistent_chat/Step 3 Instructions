# Step 3: Persistent Chat (Single Client)

We extended the server and client to support continuous messaging until one side types `exit`.

---

## 🔨 What We Built
- **Server**: stays connected and keeps reading messages until client disconnects.
- **Client**: can send multiple messages and receive server responses.

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run
Terminal 1 (Server):
```bash
gcc server_chat.c -o server_chat
./server_chat
Terminal 2 (Client):

bash
Copy code
gcc client_chat.c -o client_chat
./client_chat
