🚧 Troubleshooting

Issue: “Segmentation fault” after client disconnect
✅ Fix: Always free() the socket pointer in handle_client.

Issue: Memory leaks from threads
✅ Fix: Use pthread_detach() so finished threads clean themselves up.

❓ Checkpoint Questions

Q1: Why do we need threads for multiple clients?
A1: Because otherwise the server would block on one client and ignore others.

Q2: Why do we use pthread_detach(thread_id)?
A2: To automatically free resources when a thread exits, avoiding memory leaks.

Q3: What happens if we forget detach or join?
A3: Threads become “zombies” and consume system resources until the server eventually crashes.
