# Step 4: Threaded Multi-Client Server

We upgraded our server to support **multiple clients at the same time** by using threads.

---

## 🔨 What We Built
- **Server**: Spawns a new thread for each client.
- **Client**: Same as Step 3 (can reuse `chat_client.c`).

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run
Terminal 1 (Server):
```bash
gcc threaded_server.c -o threaded_server -lpthread
./threaded_server
Terminal 2+ (Clients):

bash
Copy code
gcc chat_client.c -o chat_client
./chat_client
